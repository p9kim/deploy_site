                    Hello There! I’m a software engineer whose main focus is in
                    back-end development. But I also love building and designing purpose driven
                    intuitive UX/UI, front-end development.

            <section class="about">
                I’m a recent graduate of University of California San Diego. 
                I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Science Human Computer 
                Interactions. <br><br>

                At first I started out solely on back-end, and greatly came to 
                appreciate and love the feeling of finding elegant solutions to 
                complex problems. During one of my first projects however I was 
                part of the design team and found it to be great fun. I took many 
                design courses in conjunction to my computer science courses thereafter.  
                Creating a purposeful and user friendly/intuitive design paired 
                with efficient back-end is what I believe to be paramount to a 
                successful product. <br><br>
                
                Besides coding, my other hobbies include hiking/trail running, 
                camping, and if possible travelling.

                    <p>An API that allows users to store files on the cloud. 
                        This was built using two different types of servers, 
                        three metadata servers and a block server. The 
                        metadata server would keep track of information of 
                        files such as the name, version, and blocklist. 
                        Depending on the operation metadata server would 
                        essentially communicate with block server to see if 
                        a file’s blocks of data are stored on the block server, 
                        but before all this version numbers are checked with the 
                        metadata server so race conditions do not occur. </p>

                        if threshold is passed then additional content or service will be provided. A

                        favorites as well as create additional lists. Tools will be provided for orgnization of user's 
                        personal beer database.
                        OnTap will provide a database of breweries 
                        and the beers made at that brewery. Data will neatly coupled to allow for ease of 
                        search. Beers can be search by city, type, brewery, flavor, or a combinatiion of those.
                        Brewery pages will be accompanied by a list of their beers prioritizing those on tap. 
                        Breweries will also be searchable by city. Lastly beers on tap will be clearly marked.

                        with others allowing them to download the file until expiration time. 
                        When expiration time is up link and file will be deleted from the server. </p>
